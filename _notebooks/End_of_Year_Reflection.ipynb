    "In the bast before, I really just did what my scrub master told me to do, and nothing much besides that. I decided to change and take initiative and join a new group. Within that new group I became the scrub master. Although I wasn't that outgoing with other groups, I feel like being in that group made me become more talkative and helped me become more of a leader. I learned how to become better at guiding other people and was able to take out the good in people"

    "- Since I was already a part of CSSE tools were a walk in the park for me. Now for the fundamental of JavaScript and Python, I was still semi familiar, but when fellow students went over specific topics using both Python and JS, I feel like a grasped a better understanding of the topic.\n",
    "- Digital Famine was an amazing project to work on, especially with my team. Although I only coded one of the games myself for the Bias sort game, I had other struggles withing the team too. Since the team was mostly newer people, we had more problems with commits and pull requests which made me put more of my time into that, but I still managed to get it done. That wasn't the only thing I did, though. Whenever somebody had a problem with their code or vscode I would always be first responder to try to fix the problem. Whenever someone wasn't sure on what to do I told them to walk me through what they have done and give them insipiration to continue on even more. I also helped coding wise with a lot of formatting and styling since I have used html multiple times previously of taking this class."
