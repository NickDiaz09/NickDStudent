    "1. Check configurations first; small mistakes like a wrong email can block progress.\n",
    "2. Directory and environment organization save a lot of future headaches.\n",
    "3. Activating the right virtual environment is essential for consistency.\n",
    "4. Knowing your tool versions prevents unexpected behavior.\n",

    "Overall, this was a hands-on lesson in patience, attention to detail, and the importance of setup before coding."
