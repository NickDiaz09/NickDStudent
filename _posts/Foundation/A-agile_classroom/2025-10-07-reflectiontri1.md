## 1️⃣ Compare Yourself to the Beginning of the Year
In the bast before, I really just did what my scrub master told me to do, and nothing much besides that. I decided to change and take initiative and join a new group. Within that new group I became the scrub master. Although I wasn't that outgoing with other groups, I feel like being in that group made me become more talkative and helped me become more of a leader. I learned how to become better at guiding other people and was able to take out the good in people


## 2️⃣ Sprint Reflections

- Since I was already a part of CSSE tools were a walk in the park for me. Now for the fundamental of JavaScript and Python, I was still semi familiar, but when fellow students went over specific topics using both Python and JS, I feel like a grasped a better understanding of the topic.
- Digital Famine was an amazing project to work on, especially with my team. Although I only coded one of the games myself for the Bias sort game, I had other struggles withing the team too. Since the team was mostly newer people, we had more problems with commits and pull requests which made me put more of my time into that, but I still managed to get it done. That wasn't the only thing I did, though. Whenever somebody had a problem with their code or vscode I would always be first responder to try to fix the problem. Whenever someone wasn't sure on what to do I told them to walk me through what they have done and give them insipiration to continue on even more. I also helped coding wise with a lot of formatting and styling since I have used html multiple times previously of taking this class.


## 3️⃣ N@tM Reflection

- Our presentation went amazing. We had multiple people who seemed very interested in our topics. Although not many played the actual game (because I think they were afraid to), they still really enjoyed the game and the asthetics of the site. They asked various questions that made get more into the more developer oreiented vision to respond to them.
- Most of our feed back was incrisingly positive. It was more of a question than  a feedback, but one person asked me a very specific question on the code, and it made me nervous, but I was still able to respond to him confidently and correctly.



## 4️⃣ Next Steps for Your Project

- If we had more time, I would 100% take time to go through our project and change the way our homepage looks as it looks the same as the plagarism quest except with a few visual tweaks. I would also even take time with other groups to help thme with those type of things as well.


## 5️⃣ What’s Next in Computer Science?

- I am very excited to learn about Data Science as over the summer, I went to UC Berkeley and took two college level classes about Computer Science and Data Scinece. Although Data Science was much harder, it was still a very fun experience and fun to learn about.


## 6️⃣ Analytics Review
- 95 contributions in this trimester.
- 20 pull requests
- 26 Issues



## 7️⃣ MCQ Review

- The MCQ was arguably challenging, it had some confusing questions and some of the code based questions also through me off and left me thinking.
- The score I got was a 44/66 which overall is not bad at all.
- I missed: Q13, Q14, Q18, Q21, Q23, Q27-30, Q32, Q40, Q43, Q46-47, Q59-60, Q62-66
- I went through each question I got wrong and realized, its because I did not read the questions 100% and missed a key detail leading me to get the question wrong.
- I took a more do what I know first approach calmly then go back to questions I did not know and save those for last, as that will most likely be my approach for the actual AP Exam. Next time I must read through each question 100%.


## 8️⃣ Something Cool to Share
- This year, I started working on a project with my dad for his music company, basically it is a website that does his job for him, and although it is not as good as when he does it in his music studio, it's still pretty darn good.
